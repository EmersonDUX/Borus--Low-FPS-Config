Borus'--Low-FPS-Config
=====================

Not Responsible for anything that happens to the users game or account when using this cofig!

Place files into C:/APB/APBGame/Config

Then you have to run the game from the C:/APB/Binaries - APB application



Note: /fps will still show that you have low fps, however gameplay will be "smoother" and it should NOT stutter or lag as much, if at all.

The name Borus' Low FPS Config only indicates that I use it and have done changes to the files from the originals, not that i own the code, but have changed some.



Special thanks to USPStyle for fixing the code to make the config compatable with the 1.2 patch!


Edits: 

7/2/2013 - Code changes made by USPStyle to make it compatable with the 1.2 patch


7/5/2013 - Decreased some lodbias' and maxlod's to decrease lag




To Do:

Decrease lodbias' and max lods further while keeping the visuals almost the same and keeping it so the game doesn't crash on startup.
