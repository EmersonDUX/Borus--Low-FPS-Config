Borus'--Low-FPS-Config
=====================

Not Responsible for anything that happens to the users game or account when using this cofig!

Place files into C:/APB/APBGame/Config



Note: /fps will still show that you have low fps, however gameplay will be "smoother" and it should NOT stutter or lag as much, if at all.

The name Borus' Low FPS Config only indicates that I use it and have done changes to the files from the originals, not that i own the code, but have changed some.
